The binaries in ../extlibs/mingw-libs/x86 and ../extlibs/bin/x86/mingw were built with MinGW-w64 using the following configuration:
  - POSIX threads
  - Dwarf exceptions
  - i686 architecture
  - GCC 5.4.0
You build with
  make [config=debug|release]
and your builds should be distributed with the files in ../extlibs/bin/x86/mingw
